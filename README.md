# Solidity Learning Projects

This repository contains **hands-on Solidity projects** created while following the course  
**“Become an Ethereum Blockchain Developer”** (October 2023), with updates and adaptations to reflect **modern Ethereum development practices**.

The projects progress from Ethereum fundamentals to more advanced topics such as **ERC20 tokens, smart wallets, and NFTs**.  
Each chapter focuses on a specific concept and is intentionally **small, clear, and educational**, rather than production-ready.

---

## What this repository demonstrates

- Writing **Solidity smart contracts**
- Understanding Ethereum fundamentals (accounts, gas, ownership)
- Implementing **ERC20 and ERC721 (NFT)** standards
- Using modern Ethereum tooling:
  - **Remix IDE** (early chapters)
  - **Hardhat v3 + TypeScript + Viem**
  - **Foundry (Forge & Scripts)** for testing and deployment
- Writing unit tests, deployment scripts, and verifying contracts
- Deploying contracts to **Ethereum testnets (Sepolia)**

> **Note**  
> Parts of the original course use **outdated tooling** (e.g. Truffle, older Hardhat versions).  
> Where applicable, these were replaced with **modern, up-to-date workflows**.
