# The Smart Money - Deposit and Withdrawals

My Solidity practice for handling ETH deposits and withdrawals in a Solidity smart contract.


### Behavior

- Accepting ETH deposits
- Reading the contract balance
- Withdrawing all ETH to the caller or another address



### Files / Iterations

- v1: Initial attempt (incorrect ETH accounting)
- v2: Correct version (added ownership, withdraw, call instead of transfer)
- v3: Code presented in the course.
- v4: Deposit function added (instead of click on Transact button in Remix IDE).
